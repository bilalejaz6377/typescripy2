//Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic.
// Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. 
//• Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. •
// Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!

// Array of animals with a common characteristic
const animals: string[] = ['Dog', 'Cat', 'Rabbit'];

// Print the name of each animal using a for loop
console.log("Printing animal names:");
for (let animal of animals) {
    console.log(animal);
}

// Print a statement about each animal
console.log("\nPrinting statements about each animal:");
for (let animal of animals) {
    console.log(`A ${animal.toLowerCase()} would make a great pet.`);
}

// Print a statement about what these animals have in common
